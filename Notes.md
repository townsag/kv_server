- create a server struct instance, it is similar to a fastapp app object
    - give the server struct instance a handler function which is a ServeMux object
    - handler can be wrapped with middleware
- consider the fat service pattern when I want to structure the app better:
    - [fat-service-link-alex-edwards](https://www.alexedwards.net/blog/the-fat-service-pattern)

- goals:
    - structured logging
        - request id
        - log level
        - log events at the application level like adding or removing key value pairs
    - observability
        - prometheus
            - histogram: request latency
            - counter: total requests
            - gauge: num concurrently served requests
    - maintainability:
        - test automation
            - correctness tests at kv store level
            - correctness tests at application level
            - performance test at application level
    - correctness:
        - property testing at application level
    - performance:
        - high degree of parallelism?
